### Introduction
In the face of the upcoming 2022 World Cup, we wanted to visualize in our project the previous head-to-head records of the World Cup teams,
the information of each team, and the information of each player. Our target audience is everyone who wants to know and see the World Cup data. 
In our website, you can see the head-to-head records of the teams, each team's match records in recent years, player information, etc.
It is also possible to compare the teams that are about to play against each other, giving a more intuitive feeling from the data.
