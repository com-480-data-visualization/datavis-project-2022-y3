                <p>
                    With the failure to qualify for the 2022 QATAR World Cup finals, national's confidence in Chinese
                    football drops to the lowest point. Many Chinese Super League teams announced their
                    withdrawal from the new season of the Chinese Super League,even last year's champion team
                    announced its disbandment less than three months after winning the championship.<br><br>

                    Compared to China's Asian Neighbors, Korean and Japanese football has been creating miracles,
                    but Chinese football has always been making farce.China has only one player in the top five European
                    leagues, while South Korea and Japan have many high-level players andhave the strength
                    to play against world-class teams. Recently, Son Heung-min won the Golden Boot with 0 penalties,
                    creating Asian history. He became the first Asian to win the Golden Boot in the top five European
                    leagues.<br><br>

                    Most people just want to see the results, but few are dedicated to the process
                    of Chinese football. There are too many people watching dramas, but too few serious people.

                <p>
                    The exploits of China’s national women’s football team, the ‘Iron Roses’, who were FIFA Women’s World Cup
                    runners-up in 1999 and perennial Asian champions in the 1990s,
                    further raised expectations.The Chinese women's national football team staged an "epic reversal" in the
                    2022 Women's Asian Cup final. After falling behind by two goals, they scored three goals in a row. With
                    a stoppage-time goal, they defeated South Korea and won the Asian championship again after 16 years.</br></br>
                    Instead, China’s men’s team has struggled, and been comfortably outperformed by its
                    similarly late-developing East Asian neighbours South Korea and Japan, for the past two
                    decades.5 China’s only qualification for the men’s FIFA World Cup finals tournament came
                    in 2002, but it lost all three games. Since then it has lurched between brief flickers of promise
                    and abject failure, including humiliating defeats to Thailand and United States Major League
                    Soccer (MLS) club Real Salt Lake, and even dropping out of the top 100 of
                    the FIFA World Rankings in 2013. As of August 2017 it languishes in 77th place, sandwiched
                    between Sierra Leone and Qatar. Chinese men's football team once again lost its qualification
                    for the 2022 World Cup without any accident.

                <h3 class="common_title">Possible Reason</h3>
                <p>
                    In ‘Bamboo Goalposts’, Rowan Simons’ examination of contemporary Chinese football,
                    Simons argues that China’s failure in football results from the lack of grassroots-level
                    participation that sustains traditional football nations. Despite its vast population, very few
                    Chinese citizens actually play football. The absence of the informal football activity is partly
                    due to lack of places to play. Even by 1998, Beijing had only 30 football pitches for its 12
                    million inhabitants, mostly owned by universities. Amateur football has
                    also been suppressed by laws requiring state approval for gatherings of 10 or more people.
                    </br></br>However, rather than encouraging all of its citizens to kick a ball about for fun, developing
                    public football facilities, and generally stimulating wider interest and involvement in the
                    game, the Chinese government has focused on achieving international success as quickly as
                    possible. To do this it has applied the top-down sports development model implemented
                    successfully for Olympic sports, devoting its resources to identifying and hothousing elite
                    talent at a very young age. Coaching has often been outsourced to foreign coaches hired from
                    whichever nations were successful in world football at that time, as opposed to the more
                    sustainable model of China developing its own coaches.
                    </br></br>Furthermore, after
                    an encouraging start to the professional era, even China’s domestic football has offered little
                    to inspire would-be young footballers to take up the game. Despite a 2004 rebranding and reformation
                    of the Jia-A League to become the Chinese Super League, the competition was increasingly beset
                    by corruption involving gambling and match-fixing.

                                <b>Cuju</b>, which literally means “kick ball”, was a

                                teams and goals. Cuju was popularised in the <b>Han dynasty</b> from <b>200BC</b> as a form of military
                                training, and remained part of Chinese culture for the next <b>1800</b> years. Popularity peaked in the
                                <b>Southern Song dynasty (1127-1279)</b>, with the establishment of cuju leagues, professional players and a transfer market.

                                early 1980s, bringing greater competition and funds, but a fully professional national
                                competition, the Jia-A League, did not begin until 1994. Chinese domestic football mirrored
                                the national economy in transitioning rapidly from almost complete state-sponsorship and
                                central planning to a more diverse market-oriented system, with commercially-sponsored
                                teams, transfer fees, and even a handful of overseas players.Football’s increasing
                                commercialisation and hegemonic status amongst world sports throughout the 1990s and
                                2000s had coincided with China’s extraordinary economic development.

                                In 2002, the Chinese team entered the World Cup finals for the first time, which greatly
                                inspired the people of the whole country. However, in the following 20 years, Chinese football
                                has gradually entered a desperate predicament.

                                In 2015 the Chinese government set out a blueprint for developing the sport, including
                                the intent to bid for the World Cup. As a result, football has been widely introduced as
                                part of the school curriculum. China’s domestic football league has also received
                                rapid and substantial investment, both from government and private enterprises. Guangzhou
                                FC won the AFC Champions League twice in 2013 and 2015, which once gave us hope.
