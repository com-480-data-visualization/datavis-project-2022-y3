## Dataset

Our work is based on two datasets from Kaggle, one with international football match records and the other with player data.

The first dataset ("match_results.csv") contains **43,170** results of international football matches starting from the very first official match in 1872 up to 2022. The matches range from FIFA World Cup to FIFI Wild Cup to regular friendly matches. The matches are strictly men's full internationals and the data does not include Olympic Games or matches where at least one of the teams was the nation's B-team, U-23 or a league select team. And we will be interested in the following information:

- `date` : date of the match
- `home_team` : the name of the home team
- `away_team` : the name of the away team
- `home_score` : full-time home team score including extra time, not including penalty-shootouts
- `away_score` : full-time away team score including extra time, not including penalty-shootouts
- `tournament` : the name of the tournament
- `city` : the name of the city/town/administrative unit where the match was played
- `country` : the name of the country where the match was played

The second dataset ("players_22.csv") provided include the players data for the Career Mode from FIFA 22 . This data provides more than 100 attributes for players such as 

- `short_name` and `long_name` : player name
- `player_position` : player preferred positions in the court
- `overall` : Player current overall score
- `valeur_eur` : player value in EUR
- ...

These two dataset are clean but we still need to do some data pre-processiong especailly in terms of data transformation. Some new properties of data are created from existing attributes to help in the data analysis process. For example, home_team, home_score, away_score can be transformed to another property like home_win_rate for each team, which will be directly used in the future work.



## Problematic

In the face of the upcoming 2022 World Cup, we wanted to visualize in our project the previous head-to-head records of the World Cup teams, the information of each team, and the information of each player. Our target audience is everyone who wants to know and see the World Cup data. In our website, you can see the head-to-head records of the teams, each team's match records in recent years, player information, etc. It is also possible to compare the teams that are about to play against each other, giving a more intuitive feeling from the data. This can even help viewers predict game scores and win football pools.
